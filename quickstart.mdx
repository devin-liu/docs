## Set Up Your Development Environment

Learn how to edit, preview, and publish your documentation with ease.

### Edit and Preview Your Docs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Your Documentation Repository">
    As part of the onboarding process, a repository containing your documentation was created on your GitHub. You can access this repository via the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To work on your docs locally, clone the repository to your computer by following these [GitHub cloning instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview Changes Locally">
    Previewing your changes ensures your documentation is accurate and polished before publishing. With the **Mintlify CLI**, you can easily render and test updates locally:
    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) by running:  
       ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Navigate to the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is located) and run:  
       ``` mintlify dev ```
    This will open a local server to preview your edits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy Your Documentation

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the GitHub App">
  Simplify deployment with our GitHub app, which automates publishing your documentation changes. Install the app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once installed, a checkmark will appear next to the commit hash in your repository, confirming successful deployment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push Your Changes to Deploy">
  After editing, commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository. For guidance, refer to [Git's push documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push). If automatic deployment doesn’t work, you can manually update your site from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
